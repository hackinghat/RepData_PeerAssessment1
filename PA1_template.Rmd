```{r echo=FALSE}
library(lattice)
```

### Loading and preprocessing the data

Load the data and merge the date and interval columns to produce a single date/time
```{r echo=TRUE}

activity<-read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses=c('integer','Date','integer'))
activity$datetime <- as.POSIXct(tz="GMT", origin=activity$date, 
                          as.integer(activity$interval/100)*3600 + 
                          activity$interval%%100*60)
summary(activity)
clean_activity<-activity[!is.na(activity$steps), c("interval", "steps", "date")]
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Ignore the missing values in the dataset and produce a histogram, then calculate and report the mean and median number of steps.


```{r}
hist(clean_activity$steps, main="Frequency of steps", xlab="Number of steps")
mean(clean_activity$steps)
median(clean_activity$steps)
```


### What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
clean_steps_by_interval<-aggregate(list(Avg.Steps=clean_activity$steps), by=list(Time.of.day=clean_activity$interval), FUN=mean)
plot(Avg.Steps ~ Time.of.day, clean_steps_by_interval, type="l")
```


### Imputing missing values

```{r}
nas<-is.na(activity$steps)
sum(nas)
```

We will impute the missing values by calculating the average number of steps for that day.   This should keep the distribution the same.

```{r}
# We will use the average for the supplied date to try and keep the po
impute_table<-aggregate(list(steps=clean_activity$steps), by=list(date=clean_activity$date), FUN=mean)
# Set the row names of the impute table so that we can do lookups from it
row.names(impute_table)<-impute_table$date
# If a step column is NA then look it up from the table, if that value is NA then zero
impute_steps<-function (row) {
  if (is.na(row["steps"])) {
    s<-impute_table[row["date"], "steps"]
    if (is.na(s)) {
      as.integer(0)
    } else {
      as.integer(s)
    }
  } else {
    as.integer(row["steps"])
  }
}
imputed_activity<-activity
imputed_activity$steps<-as.integer(apply(activity, 1, impute_steps))
```

Now we produce a histogram of the adjusted data (plus mean/median results).

```{r}
hist(imputed_activity$steps, main="Frequency of steps", xlab="Number of steps")
mean(imputed_activity$steps)
median(imputed_activity$steps)
```

This shows that adding the imputed data pushed the mean lower, however the frequency distribution shape was unchanged.   As expected.

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
# First get a vector of the days of week
dow<-as.integer(strftime(imputed_activity$datetime, "%w"))
# Then construct daytype factor based on whether the dow is 0 (Sunday) or 6 (Saturday)
imputed_activity$daytype<-factor(dow==0|dow==6,levels=c(FALSE, TRUE),labels=c("weekday", "weekend"))
```

Now make a panel plot showing the different activity based on whether the measurement was a weekend or not.


```{r}
imputed_weekend_by_interval<-aggregate(steps ~ interval + daytype, data= imputed_activity[, c("steps", "daytype", "interval")], FUN=mean)
xyplot(steps~interval|daytype, imputed_weekend_by_interval, type="l", ylab="Number of steps", xlab="Interval", layout=c(1, 2))
```
